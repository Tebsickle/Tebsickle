## <center> About Me </center>

Hello! I'm a Computer Science student in the Class of 2029 at North Carolina State University. I like expressing my creative side as much as possible, and enjoy learning how various systems work from the ground up. I typically work with Python, Java, C#, or Brigadier, Minecraft's command language. 

- I primarily think about problems from a theory perspective, and working backwards from there.
- I always ask myself, "How was that done?"
